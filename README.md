# Decibel

Demoed at http://www.italian-elixir.org/ running on a Raspberry Pi 3.

Slides at https://connettiva.eu/elixirday2016/

## Installation

    sudo apt-get install tshark

Dependency: nvm https://github.com/creationix/nvm

    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash
    source .bashrc
    nvm install v5.7.0
    nvm use v5.7.0
    git clone https://github.com/pmontrasio/decibel
    cd decibel
    echo "v5.7.0" > .nvmrc
    mix deps.get
    iex -S mix phoenix.server # to install dependencies and compile Elixir files
    ^C^C
    cd apps/decibel
    npm install
    cd ../..

See the paragraph about capabilities at the end for an explanation about these two lines:

    sudo setcap 'CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' /sbin/iwconfig
    sudo setcap 'CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' /sbin/ifconfig

Add the user to the wireshark group, to let it sniff packets

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
    sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER

Leave the shell and reconnect to get a connection with the wireshark group id.

## Run

cd decibel
nvm use v5.7.0
source .env
iex -S mix phoenix.server
KV.Registry.create(KV.Registry, "channels")
KV.Registry.create(KV.Registry, "addresses")
{:ok, _} = Arp.Table.start_link()
{:ok, ma} = MacAddress.start_link(self())

# The next part of this document

What follows is a not very organized list of interesting points and discoveries made during the coding of this application.
It's provided here because it could be useful to other people experimenting in this area.

# Access Point on the Raspberry

An alternate setup would be having the Raspberry as Access Point and server. It wouldn't require an external AP.

I didn't manage to make it run but apparently the instructions at

http://elinux.org/RPI-Wireless-Hotspot (steps 1, 2, 3 and 5)

and at

https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=137932&p=920070#p919980

are correct.

We don't need step 4 of the latter document because we don't want to get out on the Internet.


# WiFi adapters with monitor mode

The internal WiFi adapter of the Raspberry Pi 3 doesn't have monitor mode.

https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=49432

These work with Kali Linux, but they are not certified to work with the Raspberry
http://www.wirelesshack.org/top-kali-linux-compatible-usb-adapters-dongles-2015.html

The good chips apparently are

* Atheros AR9271
* Ralink RT3070
* Ralink RT3572
* Realtek 8187L (Wireless G adapters)

https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/369
It seems that the driver for the rtl8192cu works now.

I got a TP-LINK TL-WN722N which work well. Only 2.4 GHz band.

# Setup monitor mode

## With virtual card

We add a virtual card to wlo1 and set it to monitor mode

    sudo iw dev wlo1 interface add mon0 type monitor
    iw dev

The output should be something like this

    phy#0
    	Interface mon0
    		ifindex 12
    		type monitor  <--- the new mon0 is in monitor mode
    	Interface wlo1
    		ifindex 3
    		type managed  <---- the original wlan 0 is still managed

    sudo iw mon0 info
    sudo ifconfig mon0 up
    sudo tshark -i mon0 -f 'broadcast' -T fields -e frame.time_epoch -e wlan.sa \
       -e radiotap.dbm_antsignal -e wlan.fc.type -e wlan.fc.subtype
    sudo ifconfig mon0 down
    sudo iw dev mon0 del


## With the physical card

This is what I ended up doing.

### systemd (Ubuntu 16.04)

    sudo service wpa_supplicant stop
    sudo ifconfig wlo1 down
    sudo iwconfig wlo1 mode Monitor   
    sudo ifconfig wlo1 up
    sudo service wpa_supplicant start

This means that only stopping and starting should be done manually.
The other commands are run by ```channel_monitor```.


### non systemd (Ubuntu 12.04 and Raspbian)

Enable the wireless network from the network manager and

    sudo ifconfig wlan0 down

but it keeps going back up

    sudo wpa_cli -i wlan0 terminate

doesn't stop it.

Disabling wireless with

    sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode Monitor
    sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
    SIOCSIFFLAGS: Operation not possible due to RF-kill

but

    rfkill unblock wlan0
    sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

works. Now

    sudo iwconfig wlan0 channel 2
    iwlist wlan0 channel | grep "Current Frequency"

works.


# Using tshark

Interesting fields:

* radiotap.db_antsignal
* radiotap.db_txattenuation
* radiotap.dbm_antnoise
* radiotap.dbm_antsignal # sullo zbook Ã¨ l'unico valorizzato
* radiotap.txattenuation
* radiotap.txpower

Notice that tshark in Raspbian is old

    $ tshark -v
    TShark 1.6.7

It should be enough though.

    wifi on
    sudo iw dev wlo1 interface add mon0 type monitor
    sudo ifconfig mon0 up
    sudo tshark -i mon0 -f 'broadcast' -T fields -e frame.time_epoch -e wlan.sa  \
       -e radiotap.dbm_antsignal 2> /dev/null | ./bin/average.rb
    sudo ifconfig mon0 down
    sudo iw dev mon0 del
    wifi off


    cat test/2-secs | ruby/average.rb | sort

    wifi on
    sudo tshark -i mon0 -f 'broadcast' -T fields  -e frame.time_epoch -e wlan.sa \
       -e radiotap.dbm_antsignal 2> /dev/null | ruby/average.rb
    wifi off

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_mode

Monitor mode is one of the seven modes that 802.11 wireless cards can operate in: Master (acting as an access point), Managed (client, also known as station), Ad hoc, Mesh, Repeater, Promiscuous, and Monitor mode.

You can use it to listen to all packets but you're not connected to an access point so you can't decrypt them.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode

You connect to an access point then you can do packet sniffing. Getting somebody else's packets exposes to the attacks directed to that other guy.

# TODO

1) Implement channel hopping, to detect packets on all channels (some Wi-Fi networks use more than one channel).

    sudo ifconfig wlan1 down
    sudo iwconfig wlan1 mode Monitor
    sudo ifconfig wlan1 up
    sudo iwconfig wlan1 channel 1 # It doesn't work all the times
    iwlist wlan1 channel | grep "Current Frequency"
    sudo iwconfig wlan1 channel 2 # Starting with 2 always works.
    iwlist wlan1 channel | grep "Current Frequency"
    sudo iwconfig wlan1 channel 3
    iwlist wlan1 channel | grep "Current Frequency"

    sudo iwconfig wlan1 channel 8; iwlist wlan1 channel | grep "Current Frequency"
    sudo tshark -i wlan1 -f 'broadcast' -T fields -e frame.time_epoch -e wlan.sa  \
       -e radiotap.dbm_antsignal 2> /dev/null| ruby average.rb 30

Add -e radiotap.channel.freq if you feel like

    sudo tshark -i wlan1 -f 'broadcast' -T fields -e frame.time_epoch -e wlan.sa \
       -e radiotap.dbm_antsignal 2> /dev/null

    sudo tshark -i wlan1 -f 'broadcast' -T fields -e radiotap.channel.freq \
       -e frame.time_epoch -e wlan.sa  -e radiotap.dbm_antsignal 2> /dev/null

    sudo ifconfig wlan1 down
    sudo iwconfig wlan1 mode Managed
    sudo ifconfig wlan1 up

You don't need to kill the wpa_supplicant process, but if you have to here's how to do it

    sudo kill $(cat /run/wpa_supplicant.wlan1.pid)

    sudo /sbin/wpa_supplicant -s -B -P /run/wpa_supplicant.wlan1.pid -i wlan1 \
       -D nl80211,wext -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

# Channel hopping

This is the basic channel hopping script

    for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13; do
      sudo iwconfig wlo1 channel $i
      tshark -i wlo1 -f 'broadcast' -T fields -e frame.time_epoch -e wlan.sa \
        -e radiotap.dbm_antsignal -e wlan.fc.type -e wlan.fc.subtype
      # wait some time
    done
    # start again

To shut it down

    sudo ifconfig wlo1 down
    sudo iwconfig wlo1 mode Managed
    sudo ifconfig wlo1 up

Often the network card never gets an IP address again.

To avoid sudo you can use the capabilities

    sudo setcap 'CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' /sbin/iwconfig
    sudo setcap 'CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' /sbin/ifconfig

Restore the original status with

    sudo setcap -r /sbin/iwconfig
    sudo setcap -r /sbin/ifconfig
